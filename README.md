Building a Neural Network model to identify the artist given their art.

The website is currently hosted on Google Cloud (please excuse any delays, I couldn't afford to host it in multiple regions).

Some sample URLs to test the model: https://www.gpsmycity.com/img/gd/2081.jpg - Made by Titian

The Flask app currently only takes in URLs of jpg files. I am working on an update where the app will accept uploaded images in addition to the URLs. Thanks for your patience.

The model was built using a Convolution Neural Network and has been trained to recognize the paintings of the following legends:

- Vincent van Gogh: (1853 - 1890), Dutch, (Post-Impressionism)
- Edgar Degas: (1834 - 1917), French, (Impressionism)

- Pierre-Auguste Renoir: (1841 - 1919), French, (Impressionism)
- Albrecht Durer: (1471 - 1528), German, (Northern Renaissance)
- Paul Gauguin: (1848 - 1903), French, (Symbolism,Post-Impressionism)
- Francisco Goya: (1746 - 1828), Spanish, (Romanticism)
- Rembrandt: (1606 - 1669), Dutch, (Baroque)
- Alfred Sisley: (1839 - 1899), French,British, (Impressionism)
